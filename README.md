## CS-Prediction-app Instructions
This repository includes three implementations of the proposed compressive strength (CS) prediction application, designed for both web-based deployment and local execution.

### 1. Web Application (Streamlit)
- **File:** `app.py`  
- **Description:**  
  This file contains the Python code used to deploy the web-based application using Streamlit.
- **Access:**  
  The web app can be accessed directly via the Streamlit link provided in the associated paper.
  
- File: python_code
- Description: This folder contains a standalone Python implementation of the app.
- Usage: Users can copy and paste the code then run the code locally using Python on their personal computer.
  - **File:** `app.py`  
- **Description:**  
  This file contains the Python code used to deploy the web-based application using Streamlit.
- **Access:**  
  The web application can be accessed directly via the Streamlit link provided in the associated paper.
### 3. MATLAB App Designer Implementation  
- Open MATLAB App Designer → Click Open → Select Matlab.mlapp.
- **File:** `Matlab.mlapp`  
- **Access:**  
  The MATLAB application is provided as an App Designer file (`.mlapp`) and can be executed on personal computers with MATLAB installed.
- **Usage:**  
  To run the application:
  1. Download `Matlab.mlapp` from the repository.
  2. Execute the application using one of the following methods:
     - Double-click the `Matlab.mlapp` file, or
     - Open **MATLAB App Designer**, click **Open**, and select `Matlab.mlapp`.
      - Open MATLAB App Designer → Click Open → Select Matlab.mlapp.
