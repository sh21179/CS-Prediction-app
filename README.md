## CS-Prediction-app Instructions
This repository includes three implementations of the proposed compressive strength (CS) prediction application, designed for both web-based and local use. The application is based on Quadratic Model 2, which demonstrated high predictive accuracy using the material parameters defined in the associated research study.

### General Usage
- Enter numerical values in all input fields.
- Click Predict to calculate the compressive strength.
- Click Clear to reset.

### 1. Web Application (Streamlit)
- **File:** `app.py`  
- **Description:**  
  This file contains the Python code for deploying the web-based application using Streamlit.
- **Usage:**  
  Users can access the application directly via the Streamlit link provided in the associated research paper, without needing to install any software.

  ### 2. Python App  Implementation
- **File:** `Python.py`  
- **Description:**  
  This file contains a standalone Python implementation of the app that can run on personal computers with Python installed (free). 
- **Usage:**  
  To run the application: 
   1. Download `Python.py` from the repository.
   2. Run the app by double-clicking the file.
  
### 3. MATLAB App Designer Implementation  
- **File:** `Matlab.mlapp`  
- **Description:**  
  This file contains the MATLAB App Designer file (`.mlapp`) that can be executed on personal computers with MATLAB installed.
- **Usage:**  
  To run the application:
  1. Download `Matlab.mlapp` from the repository.
  2. Run the application using one of the following methods:
     - Double-click the `Matlab.mlapp` file, or
     - Open MATLAB App Designer, click Open, and select `Matlab.mlapp`.
