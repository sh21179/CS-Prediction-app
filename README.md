## CS-Prediction-app Instructions
This repository includes three implementations of the proposed compressive strength (CS) prediction application, designed for both web-based deployment and local execution.
### 1. Web Application (Streamlit)
- File: app.py
- Description: This file contains the Python code used to deploy the web application using Streamlit.
- Access: The web app can be accessed directly via the Streamlit link provided in the paper.
### 2. Python Standalone Implementation
- File: python_code
- Description: This folder contains a standalone Python implementation of the app.
- Usage: Users can copy and paste the code then run the code locally using Python on their personal computer.
### 3. MATLAB App Designer Implementation  
 File: Matlab.mlapp
Access: The MATLAB application is provided as an App Designer file (`.mlapp`) and can be run on personal computers with MATLAB installed. 
To run the application:
1. Download `Matlab.mlapp` from the repository.
2. Execute the application using one of the following methods:
   - Double-click the `Matlab.mlapp` file, or
   - Open MATLAB App Designer → Click Open → Select Matlab.mlapp.
